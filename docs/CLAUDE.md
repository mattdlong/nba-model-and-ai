# GitHub Pages Dashboard

## Purpose

Static site served via GitHub Pages. Displays predictions, signals, and historical performance.

## Structure

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `index.html` | Landing page with today's games |
| `predictions.html` | Current betting signals |
| `history.html` | Historical performance |
| `model.html` | Model metrics and info |
| `api/` | JSON data for dynamic content |
| `assets/` | CSS and JavaScript |

## Build Process

Generated by `nba_model/output/dashboard.py`:
1. Load templates from `templates/`
2. Receive data from prediction/backtest pipelines
3. Render to static HTML and JSON
4. Write to `docs/`

## Deployment

Automatically deployed via GitHub Pages when pushed to main.

## Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Never edit HTML directly (use templates)
- ❌ Never include API keys
- ❌ Never commit without testing locally
