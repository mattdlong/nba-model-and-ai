# Development Plans

## Purpose

Contains detailed phase-by-phase implementation plans, checklists, and technical specifications.

## Structure

| File | Phase | Content |
|------|-------|---------|
| `phase1.md` | 1 | Project setup, CLI, config |
| `phase2.md` | 2 | Data collection spec |
| `phase3.md` | 3 | Feature engineering spec |
| `phase4.md` | 4 | ML architecture spec |
| `phase5.md` | 5 | Backtesting spec |
| `phase6.md` | 6 | Monitoring spec |
| `phase7.md` | 7 | Inference pipeline spec |
| `phase8.md` | 8 | Dashboard spec |

## Usage

1. Read the relevant phase doc before starting implementation
2. Use checklists to track progress
3. Update status when completing items
4. Reference from commit messages

## Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Never start a phase without reading its plan
- ❌ Never skip checklist items
- ❌ Never modify completed phase docs (archive instead)
