# Implementation Notes

## Purpose

Working notes, artifacts, and documentation generated during implementation. Not part of the main codebase.

## Contents

- Technical spike results
- Algorithm experiments
- API exploration notes
- Migration scripts
- One-off analysis

## Usage

Store temporary implementation artifacts here. Clean up after phase completion.

## Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Never put production code here
- ❌ Never reference from main package
- ❌ Never commit sensitive data
